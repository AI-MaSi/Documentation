# Motion Platform Modbus Controller

A huge thank you to **Teemu Lepp√§nen** for creating this awesome documentation and codebase for controlling a 2DOF motion platform!

## What's This?
This project lets you control a simulator motion platform using Modbus TCP. It includes both documentation and example code to get you started with Tritex II 90-115 series motors.

## Quick Setup
1. Network settings:
   - Left Motor (M1): 192.168.0.211
   - Right Motor (M2): 192.168.0.212
   - Port: 502

2. Basic controls available:
   - Direct control (Jog, Home)
   - Analog control (Position, Velocity)
   - Host control (for custom movement)

## Safety First!
Remember to check the emergency stop buttons:
- One on the pre-control unit
- One on the right side of operator cabin

## Want to Learn More?
Check out the detailed documentation that Teemu created - it covers everything from initial setup to advanced controls. The example Python code shows how to get started with basic movements.
